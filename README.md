# Running the Application

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps to run a Java application from a GitHub repository. We will assume that you have already cloned the repository to your local machine and have installed any necessary dependencies, such as an API and Docker.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the repository on GitHub.
2.  Click on the green "Code" button.
3.  Choose the option to clone the repository using either the command line or GitHub Desktop.
4.  Follow the prompts to complete the cloning process.

## Setting up the Database

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1.  Locate the `quintor.sql` file that is included with the repository.
2.  Import the file into both MariaDB and MongoDB. This will create the necessary tables and data for the application to run.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1.  Open a Java editor, such as IntelliJ.
2.  Open the main class called `StarterApplication`.
3.  Ensure that you have installed the necessary API and Docker environment before continuing.
4.  Click on the play button at the top of the editor to start the application.
5.  Wait for the application to start up. This may take some time depending on the size and complexity of the application.
6.  Once the application is running, you can access it using a web browser or another client.

## Conclusion

By cloning the repository, setting up the database, and running the main class, you can quickly get the application up and running on your local machine. Be sure to check the application's documentation for any additional instructions or configuration options.
