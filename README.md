3.  Click on the play button at the top of the editor to start the application.
4.  Wait for the application to start up. This may take some time depending on the size and complexity of the application.
5.  Once the application is running, you can access it using a web browser or another client.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we walked through the steps to run an application from GitHub. By cloning the repository and running the main class, you can quickly get the application up and running on your local machine. Be sure to check the application's documentation for any additional instructions or configuration options.
